# Peek-A-Book

Peek-A-Book is a small side project I built to experiment with computer vision and book discovery. The idea is simple. Take a 
photo of your bookshelf and the app will try to recognize the books, pull in useful details and suggest matches based on your reading preferences. You can save titles you’re curious about or jump straight to places where you can buy them.

The stack uses React on the frontend and a Django API on the backend, with large vision models handling the spine scanning. It’s still a work in progress, but it’s a fun way for me to learn more about vision pipelines, recommendations and deploying full-stack projects.
